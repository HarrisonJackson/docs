## Project: Real-Time Image Detection App

### Description
In this project, you will create a mobile or web application that performs real-time object detection using a pre-trained model. This project will help you understand how to implement and optimize computer vision models for real-time applications.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a mobile or web application that performs real-time object detection using a pre-trained model.
- Use a suitable pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, SSD).
- Implement a user-friendly interface to display detected objects and their locations in the video feed.
- Optimize the application for performance and accuracy.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, SSD).
2. Set up a backend service to handle object detection logic.
3. Develop the frontend interface to display the video feed and detected objects.
4. Integrate the object detection model with your backend to process real-time video input.
5. Test the application with various types of video feeds to ensure performance and accuracy.

### Deliverable
A real-time image detection application that identifies objects in the environment, with a user-friendly interface for viewing the video feed and detected objects.
