- Implement a user-friendly interface for users to input video URLs and view summaries.
- Provide options for different summarization lengths (short, medium, long).

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable pre-trained text summarization model (e.g., BERT, GPT-3).
2. Set up a backend service to fetch and process YouTube transcripts.
3. Integrate the summarization model with your backend to generate summaries.
4. Develop the frontend interface for users to input video URLs and view summaries.
5. Test the application with various types of videos to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### Deliverable
A web application that summarizes YouTube video transcripts, providing concise overviews with a user-friendly interface for inputting video URLs and viewing summaries.
