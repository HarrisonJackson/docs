## Project: LLM Agent with Tool and Memory

### Description
In this project, you will create an AI agent that combines the power of a large language model (LLM) with tools and memory to perform complex tasks. This project will help you understand how to enhance AI agent capabilities by integrating additional functionalities.

### Project Prompt
- Develop an AI agent that uses an LLM for understanding and generating text.
- Integrate tools such as APIs for additional functionalities (e.g., web scraping, database access).
- Implement a memory component to retain context across interactions.
- Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable LLM (e.g., GPT-3) and set up a backend for handling interactions.
2. Integrate tools via APIs to extend the agent's capabilities.
3. Implement a memory system to retain context and improve user experience.
4. Develop the frontend interface for user interaction.
5. Test the agent with various tasks to ensure effectiveness and reliability.

### Deliverable
An AI agent that leverages an LLM along with tools and memory for enhanced capabilities, with a user-friendly interface for performing complex tasks.
