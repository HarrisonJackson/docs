## Project: Text Summarization

### Description
In this project, you will build a web application that takes long-form text as input and generates a concise summary. This project will help you understand the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how to leverage pre-trained models to perform text summarization.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a web application that accepts text input from users.
- Use a pre-trained NLP model for summarizing the input text.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for uploading text and displaying summaries.
- Provide options for different summarization lengths (short, medium, long).

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable pre-trained text summarization model (e.g., BERT, GPT-3).
2. Set up a web framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or a JavaScript framework like React) for your application.
3. Integrate the summarization model with your web application.
4. Design and implement the frontend interface to accept text input and display the summary.
5. Test the application with various types of text inputs to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Deliverable
A fully functional web-based text summarization tool with a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to input text and receive a summarized version.
