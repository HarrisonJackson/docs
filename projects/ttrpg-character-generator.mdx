## Project: TTRPG Character Generator

### Description
In this project, you will develop a web application that generates characters for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) based on user inputs. This project will help you understand how to use AI for generating creative content and character profiles.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a web application that allows users to input preferences for character generation (e.g., race, class, background).
- Use AI models to generate detailed character profiles based on the inputs.
- Implement features for customizing and saving generated characters.
- Create a user-friendly interface for inputting preferences and viewing character profiles.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable AI model for character generation (e.g., GPT-3 for text generation).
2. Set up a backend service to handle character generation logic.
3. Develop the frontend interface for user input and displaying generated characters.
4. Implement customization options and saving functionality for user-generated characters.
5. Test the application with various user inputs to ensure creativity and relevance.

### Deliverable
A TTRPG character generator that creates detailed character profiles based on user inputs, with a user-friendly interface for customization and saving characters.
