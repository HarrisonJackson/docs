## Project: Twilio Phone Voice Agent

### Description
In this project, you will create a voice agent that interacts with users over the phone using Twilio and AI models. This project will help you understand how to integrate voice interactions with telephony services and AI.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a voice agent that interacts with users over the phone using Twilio and AI models.
- Implement features for speech recognition, natural language understanding, and response generation.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring the voice agent and monitoring interactions.
- Ensure the agent provides accurate and natural-sounding responses.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable AI models for speech recognition and natural language understanding (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Dialogflow).
2. Set up a backend service to handle phone interactions and integrate with Twilio.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring the voice agent and monitoring interactions.
4. Implement features for speech recognition, natural language understanding, and response generation.
5. Test the voice agent with various phone interactions to ensure accuracy and performance.

### Deliverable
A voice agent that interacts with users over the phone using Twilio and AI models, with a user-friendly interface for configuring the agent and monitoring interactions.
