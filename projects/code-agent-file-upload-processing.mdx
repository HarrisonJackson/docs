## Project: Code Agent for File Upload Processing

### Description
In this project, you will create an AI agent that processes file uploads and performs various tasks such as data extraction and transformation. This project will help you understand how to use AI to automate file processing workflows.

### Project Prompt
- Develop an AI agent that processes file uploads and performs tasks such as data extraction and transformation.
- Implement features for handling different file formats and extracting relevant data.
- Create a user-friendly interface for uploading files and managing processing tasks.
- Ensure the agent provides accurate and efficient file processing.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable AI models for natural language understanding and code generation (e.g., GPT-3).
2. Set up a backend service to handle file processing tasks and integrate with data extraction tools.
3. Develop the frontend interface for uploading files and managing processing tasks.
4. Implement features for handling different file formats and extracting relevant data.
5. Test the agent with various file uploads to ensure accuracy and performance.
