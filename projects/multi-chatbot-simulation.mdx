## Project: Multi-Chatbot Simulation

### Description
In this project, you will create a system that simulates interactions between multiple chatbots to study and improve their performance. This project will help you understand how to use AI for simulating and optimizing chatbot interactions.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a system that allows multiple chatbots to interact with each other.
- Use AI models for natural language understanding and response generation.
- Implement features for logging, analyzing, and visualizing chatbot interactions.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and monitoring simulations.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable chatbot frameworks and models for interaction (e.g., Rasa, GPT-3).
2. Set up a backend service to handle chatbot interactions and logging.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and monitoring simulations.
4. Implement features for logging, analyzing, and visualizing interactions.
5. Test the system with various chatbot configurations to ensure robustness and insightfulness.

### Deliverable
A system that simulates interactions between multiple chatbots to study and improve their performance, with a user-friendly interface for configuring and monitoring simulations.
