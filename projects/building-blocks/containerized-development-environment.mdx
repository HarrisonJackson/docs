## Project: Containerized Development Environment

### Description
In this project, you will create a containerized development environment to ensure consistency and portability across different development setups. This project will help you understand how to use containerization to improve development workflows.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a containerized development environment using Docker or similar containerization tools.
- Implement features for setting up and configuring development dependencies.
- Create a user-friendly interface for managing the development environment.
- Ensure the environment is modular and reusable across various projects.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable containerization tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
2. Set up a backend service to handle environment setup and configuration tasks.
3. Develop the frontend interface for managing the development environment.
4. Implement features for setting up and configuring development dependencies.
5. Test the environment with various development setups to ensure consistency and portability.

### Deliverable
A containerized development environment with a user-friendly interface for setting up and configuring development dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability across different development setups.
