## Project: Logging and Monitoring System

### Description
In this project, you will create a system for logging and monitoring application performance to ensure reliability and early detection of issues. This project will help you understand how to implement effective logging and monitoring practices.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a system that provides comprehensive logging and monitoring of application performance.
- Implement features for log collection, analysis, and alerting.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and viewing logs and performance metrics.
- Ensure the system is modular and reusable across various applications.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable tools and frameworks for logging and monitoring (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus).
2. Set up a backend service to handle log collection, analysis, and alerting.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and viewing logs and performance metrics.
4. Implement features for log collection, analysis, and alerting.
5. Test the system with various applications to ensure reliability and early detection of issues.

### Deliverable
A system for logging and monitoring application performance with a user-friendly interface for configuring and viewing logs and performance metrics, ensuring reliability and early detection of issues across different applications.
