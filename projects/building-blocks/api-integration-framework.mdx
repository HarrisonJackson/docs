## Project: API Integration Framework

### Description
In this project, you will create a framework for integrating and managing third-party APIs within applications. This project will help you understand how to standardize API integrations to improve the efficiency and maintainability of applications.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a framework that provides a standardized approach to integrating and managing third-party APIs.
- Implement features for handling authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and data transformation.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing API integrations.
- Ensure the framework is modular and reusable across various applications.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable libraries for API integration and management (e.g., Axios, Requests).
2. Set up a backend service to handle API integration tasks.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and managing API integrations.
4. Implement features for handling authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and data transformation.
5. Test the framework with various APIs to ensure flexibility and effectiveness.

### Deliverable
A reusable API integration framework with a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing third-party APIs, ensuring modularity and reusability across different applications.
