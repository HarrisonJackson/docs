## Project: Data Augmentation Tool

### Description
In this project, you will create a tool that performs data augmentation to enhance training datasets for machine learning models. This project will help you understand how to use data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness and performance of machine learning models.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a tool that performs various data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and noise addition for images, or synonym replacement and sentence shuffling for text.
- Implement features for customizing the augmentation process based on the specific needs of different machine learning tasks.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and running data augmentation.
- Ensure the tool is modular and reusable across various machine learning projects.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable libraries for data augmentation (e.g., Augmentor for images, TextAugment for text).
2. Set up a backend service to handle data augmentation tasks.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and running data augmentation.
4. Implement features for customizing and reusing the tool across different projects.
5. Test the tool with various datasets to ensure flexibility and effectiveness.

### Deliverable
A data augmentation tool with a user-friendly interface for configuring and running data augmentation tasks, ensuring modularity and reusability across different machine learning projects.
