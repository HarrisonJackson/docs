## Project: Automated Testing Framework

### Description
In this project, you will create a framework for automated testing of applications, ensuring reliability and robustness. This project will help you understand how to standardize testing processes to improve the quality and maintainability of applications.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a framework that provides a standardized approach to automated testing of applications.
- Implement features for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and running tests.
- Ensure the framework is modular and reusable across various applications.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable testing libraries and frameworks (e.g., Jest, Selenium, PyTest).
2. Set up a backend service to handle testing tasks and result reporting.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and running tests.
4. Implement features for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
5. Test the framework with various applications to ensure flexibility and effectiveness.

### Deliverable
A reusable automated testing framework with a user-friendly interface for configuring and running tests, ensuring modularity and reusability across different applications.
