## Project: Real-Time Data Streaming

### Description
In this project, you will create a system for real-time data streaming and processing to support dynamic applications. This project will help you understand how to implement real-time data pipelines to ensure data is processed and analyzed as it is generated.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a system that supports real-time data streaming and processing.
- Implement features for data ingestion, processing, and visualization.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and monitoring data streams.
- Ensure the system is modular and reusable across various applications.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable tools and frameworks for real-time data streaming (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Flink).
2. Set up a backend service to handle data streaming and processing tasks.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and monitoring data streams.
4. Implement features for data ingestion, processing, and visualization.
5. Test the system with various data sources to ensure flexibility and effectiveness.

### Deliverable
A system for real-time data streaming and processing with a user-friendly interface for configuring and monitoring data streams, ensuring modularity and reusability across different applications.
