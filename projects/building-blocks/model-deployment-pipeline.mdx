## Project: Model Deployment Pipeline

### Description
In this project, you will create a pipeline for deploying machine learning models into production environments. This project will help you understand how to streamline the deployment process to ensure models are deployed efficiently and reliably.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a pipeline that automates the deployment of machine learning models into production environments.
- Implement features for model versioning, monitoring, and rollback.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing model deployments.
- Ensure the pipeline is modular and reusable across various machine learning projects.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable tools and frameworks for model deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow).
2. Set up a backend service to handle model deployment tasks.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and managing model deployments.
4. Implement features for model versioning, monitoring, and rollback.
5. Test the pipeline with various models to ensure flexibility and reliability.

### Deliverable
A reusable model deployment pipeline with a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing model deployments, ensuring modularity and reusability across different machine learning projects.
