## Project: CI/CD Pipeline

### Description
In this project, you will create a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This project will help you understand how to streamline the development workflow to improve efficiency and reliability.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
- Implement features for code integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment.
- Create a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing the pipeline.
- Ensure the pipeline is modular and reusable across various projects.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable CI/CD tools and frameworks (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
2. Set up a backend service to handle build, test, and deployment tasks.
3. Develop the frontend interface for configuring and managing the pipeline.
4. Implement features for code integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment.
5. Test the pipeline with various projects to ensure flexibility and reliability.

### Deliverable
A CI/CD pipeline with a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring modularity and reusability across different projects.
