## Project: Scalable Database Setup

### Description
In this project, you will create a scalable database setup to handle large volumes of data efficiently for applications. This project will help you understand how to design and implement databases that can scale with the growth of data.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a scalable database setup using suitable database technologies.
- Implement features for data partitioning, indexing, and optimization.
- Create a user-friendly interface for managing database configuration and monitoring performance.
- Ensure the setup is modular and reusable across various applications.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable database technologies for scalability (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra).
2. Set up a backend service to handle database configuration and optimization tasks.
3. Develop the frontend interface for managing database configuration and monitoring performance.
4. Implement features for data partitioning, indexing, and optimization.
5. Test the setup with various data volumes to ensure scalability and efficiency.

### Deliverable
A scalable database setup with a user-friendly interface for managing database configuration and monitoring performance, ensuring scalability and efficiency across different applications.
