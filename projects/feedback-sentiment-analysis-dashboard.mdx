## Project: Feedback Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

### Description
In this project, you will create a dashboard that analyzes customer feedback (e.g., reviews, surveys) for sentiment and key themes. This project will help you understand how to use NLP for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and how to present insights through interactive visualizations.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a dashboard that can analyze customer feedback for sentiment and key themes.
- Use NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
- Implement features for visualizing sentiment trends and key themes through interactive charts.
- Create a user-friendly interface for uploading feedback data and viewing analysis results.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable NLP models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling (e.g., VADER for sentiment analysis, LDA for topic modeling).
2. Set up a backend service to process feedback data and perform sentiment and theme analysis.
3. Develop the frontend interface for data upload and result visualization.
4. Integrate visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js) to create interactive charts.
5. Test the dashboard with various types of feedback data to ensure accuracy and usefulness.

### Deliverable
A feedback sentiment analysis dashboard that provides insights into customer feedback through sentiment analysis and theme extraction, with a user-friendly interface for data upload and visualization.
