## Project: Code Agent with Pandas

### Description
In this project, you will create an AI agent that assists with data analysis and manipulation tasks using Pandas. This project will help you understand how to use AI to automate and enhance data processing workflows.

### Project Prompt
- Develop an AI agent that assists with data analysis and manipulation tasks using Pandas.
- Implement features for common data analysis tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI agent and managing data tasks.
- Ensure the agent provides accurate and efficient data processing.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable AI models for natural language understanding and code generation (e.g., GPT-3).
2. Set up a backend service to handle data analysis tasks and integrate with Pandas.
3. Develop the frontend interface for interacting with the AI agent and managing data tasks.
4. Implement features for common data analysis tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
5. Test the agent with various data tasks to ensure accuracy and performance.

### Deliverable
An AI agent that assists with data analysis and manipulation tasks using Pandas, with a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent and managing data tasks.
