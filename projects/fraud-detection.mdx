## Project: Fraud Detection

### Description
In this project, you will create a system to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data using machine learning. This project will help you understand how to use AI for identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a system that analyzes financial transactions to detect fraudulent activities.
- Use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies.
- Implement features for real-time monitoring and alerting of suspicious transactions.
- Create a user-friendly interface for viewing detected fraud and managing alerts.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for fraud detection (e.g., isolation forest, autoencoder).
2. Set up a backend service to process transaction data and detect fraud.
3. Develop the frontend interface for viewing detected fraud and managing alerts.
4. Implement features for real-time monitoring and alerting.
5. Test the system with various types of financial data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Deliverable
A fraud detection system that analyzes financial transactions to detect fraudulent activities, with a user-friendly interface for viewing detected fraud and managing alerts.
