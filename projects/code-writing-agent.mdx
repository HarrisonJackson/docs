## Project: Code Writing Agent

### Description
In this project, you will develop an AI agent that generates code snippets based on user descriptions and requirements. This project will help you understand how to use large language models for code generation and how to build tools that assist in programming tasks.

### Project Prompt
- Develop an AI agent that can generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions.
- Use a pre-trained language model trained on code data (e.g., OpenAI Codex).
- Implement a user-friendly interface for users to input descriptions and view generated code.
- Provide features for customizing and refining the generated code.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable language model for code generation (e.g., OpenAI Codex).
2. Set up a backend service to handle code generation requests.
3. Integrate the language model with your backend to generate code snippets.
4. Develop the frontend interface for user input and displaying generated code.
5. Test the agent with various programming tasks to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### Deliverable
A code writing agent that generates code snippets based on user descriptions, with a user-friendly interface for inputting requirements and viewing the generated code.
