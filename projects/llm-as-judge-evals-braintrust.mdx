## Project: LLM as Judge for Evals Braintrust

### Description
In this project, you will create a system where a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluates and provides feedback on various submissions, acting as a judge. This project will help you understand how to use LLMs for evaluation and feedback generation.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a system that uses an LLM to evaluate submissions and provide detailed feedback.
- Implement features for scoring, qualitative feedback, and suggestions for improvement.
- Create a user-friendly interface for submitting entries and viewing feedback.
- Integrate the system with existing platforms (e.g., evaluation systems, competitions).

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable LLM for evaluation and feedback generation (e.g., GPT-3).
2. Set up a backend service to handle submission processing and feedback generation.
3. Develop the frontend interface for submitting entries and viewing feedback.
4. Implement features for scoring, qualitative feedback, and improvement suggestions.
5. Test the system with various types of submissions to ensure accuracy and usefulness.

### Deliverable
A system where an LLM evaluates and provides feedback on various submissions, with a user-friendly interface for submitting entries and viewing feedback.
