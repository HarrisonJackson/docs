## Project: Code Agent for File Generation

### Description
In this project, you will create an AI agent that generates code files based on user specifications and requirements. This project will help you understand how to use AI for code generation and automation.

### Project Prompt
- Develop an AI agent that generates code files based on user specifications and requirements.
- Implement features for handling different programming languages and frameworks.
- Create a user-friendly interface for specifying requirements and generating code files.
- Ensure the agent provides accurate and efficient code generation.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable AI models for natural language understanding and code generation (e.g., GPT-3, Codex).
2. Set up a backend service to handle code generation tasks and integrate with development tools.
3. Develop the frontend interface for specifying requirements and generating code files.
4. Implement features for handling different programming languages and frameworks.
5. Test the agent with various code generation tasks to ensure accuracy and performance.

### Deliverable
An AI agent that generates code files based on user specifications and requirements, with a user-friendly interface for specifying requirements and generating code files.
