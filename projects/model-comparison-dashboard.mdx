## Project: Model Comparison Dashboard

### Description
In this project, you will develop a dashboard to evaluate and visualize the performance of different AI models. This project will help you understand how to compare model performance and present insights in a user-friendly manner.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a dashboard that allows users to upload model predictions and ground truth data.
- Implement features to compute and visualize performance metrics.
- Provide visualizations such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
- Create a user-friendly interface for uploading data and viewing results.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable web framework for building the dashboard (e.g., Dash, Streamlit).
2. Implement backend logic to compute performance metrics for different models.
3. Develop the frontend interface for data upload and visualization.
4. Integrate visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, Matplotlib) to create insightful charts.
5. Test the dashboard with various datasets to ensure accuracy and usability.

### Deliverable
A model comparison dashboard that evaluates and visualizes the performance of different AI models, with a user-friendly interface for data upload and result visualization.
