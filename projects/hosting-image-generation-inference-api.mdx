## Project: Hosting Image Generation Inference API

### Description
In this project, you will deploy an image generation model as a microservice using Docker and Kubernetes. This project will help you understand how to host AI models in a scalable and efficient manner.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a microservice that hosts an image generation model.
- Use Docker to containerize the model and its dependencies.
- Deploy the microservice using Kubernetes for scalability and reliability.
- Implement an API for model inference that can be accessed by clients.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable image generation model (e.g., GANs, StyleGAN).
2. Containerize the model using Docker, including all necessary dependencies.
3. Set up a Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage the microservice.
4. Develop an API for model inference and integrate it with the microservice.
5. Test the deployment with various image generation requests to ensure performance and scalability.

### Deliverable
A microservice hosting an image generation model, deployed using Docker and Kubernetes, with an accessible API for model inference.
