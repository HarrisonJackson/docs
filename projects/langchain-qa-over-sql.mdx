## Project: LangChain Q&A over SQL

### Description
In this project, you will create a Q&A system that uses LangChain to answer questions based on data stored in SQL databases. This project will help you understand how to integrate AI with database systems for information retrieval.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a Q&A system that uses LangChain to answer questions based on SQL database data.
- Implement features for querying the database and generating accurate answers.
- Create a user-friendly interface for inputting questions and viewing answers.
- Ensure the system can handle complex queries and provide relevant answers.

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable AI models and frameworks for Q&A (e.g., LangChain).
2. Set up a backend service to handle database querying and answer generation.
3. Develop the frontend interface for inputting questions and viewing answers.
4. Implement features for querying the database and generating answers.
5. Test the system with various types of questions to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### Deliverable
A Q&A system that uses LangChain to answer questions based on data stored in SQL databases, with a user-friendly interface for inputting questions and viewing answers.
