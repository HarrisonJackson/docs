## Project: Image Captioning

### Description
In this project, you will develop an application that generates descriptive captions for images using multimodal AI models. This project will help you understand how to combine computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

### Project Prompt
- Create a web interface for users to upload images.
- Use a pre-trained multimodal model to generate captions for the uploaded images.
- Display the generated captions alongside the images in the interface.
- Provide options for users to refine or edit the captions.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., Image Captioning with Transformer models).
2. Set up a backend service to handle image uploads and caption generation.
3. Develop the frontend interface for users to upload images and view captions.
4. Integrate the model with your backend to generate and display captions.
5. Test the application with various types of images to ensure accuracy and relevance of captions.

### Deliverable
An image captioning application that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images, with a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing/editing captions.
