## Project: Task Automation Agent

### Description
In this project, you will develop an AI agent that automates routine tasks such as scheduling meetings and sending reminders based on user inputs. This project will help you understand how to build AI agents that interact with various APIs to perform useful tasks.

### Project Prompt
- Develop an AI agent that understands user commands and performs routine tasks.
- Implement integrations with third-party APIs (e.g., calendar, email) to execute tasks.
- Create a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the AI agent.
- Provide features for task management and customization.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a suitable framework for building AI agents (e.g., Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework).
2. Set up a backend service to handle task automation logic.
3. Integrate with third-party APIs for executing tasks.
4. Develop the frontend interface for user interaction.
5. Test the agent with various types of tasks to ensure reliability and effectiveness.

### Deliverable
An AI agent that automates routine tasks based on user inputs, with integrations to third-party APIs and a user-friendly interface for task management.
