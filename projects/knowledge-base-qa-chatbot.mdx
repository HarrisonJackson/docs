## Project: Knowledge Base Q&A Chatbot

### Description
In this project, you will create a Q&A chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers from a large knowledge base. This project will help you understand how to combine information retrieval with language generation techniques.

### Project Prompt
- Develop a chatbot that retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and generates accurate answers.
- Use RAG techniques to combine retrieval and generation for improved responses.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for users to ask questions and view answers.
- Integrate the chatbot with popular messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Teams).

### Getting Started
1. Choose suitable retrieval and generation models for RAG (e.g., Dense Passage Retrieval with BERT).
2. Set up a backend service to handle document retrieval and answer generation.
3. Develop the frontend interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
4. Integrate the chatbot with messaging platforms for accessibility.
5. Test the chatbot with various types of queries to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### Deliverable
A Q&A chatbot that uses RAG to provide accurate answers from a knowledge base, with a user-friendly interface for asking questions and viewing responses.
